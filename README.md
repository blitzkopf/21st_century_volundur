##Browse volundur.rb.is in a 21st century browser
Volundur.rb.is has a very buggy menu implementation that uses forms in between table elements. This is not supported by any HTML standard known in existence. It used to work in MS Internet Explorer but later vesions of that won't even work. This Greasemonkey/Tepermonky script tries to make it browsable in a more modern browser, it works in Chrome.

##Usage 
Each supposed element in the menu structure is suffixed with a double asterisk "&lowast;&lowast;" which is link to hopefully the right page.
